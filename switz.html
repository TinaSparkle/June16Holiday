<p> After <a href="monaco.html"> Monaco</a>  we returned to Switzerland, this time to Lucerne, on the evening of the 22nd (Wednesday). We didn't do too much that evening, just tired after the long hot drive (approx. 8 hours in 30C, with air-con barely effective!) so we went and watched some of the Euro football games. Belgum and Ireland both won. </p>
